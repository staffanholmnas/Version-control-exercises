Hi, fellow geeks!

This is me typing a long text for an exercise that needs to be modified
later on. I'm using the unix based console Git Bash to modify my
GitHub repository. It is important to learn Git version control even 
though it doesn't feel quite intuitive right now. I wonder how much
text is required, perhaps I will copy and paste more text here using 
notepad. Nope, this is enough... The end!
