Hello!

This is me typing a long text for an exercise that needs to be modified
later on. It is important to learn git even though it doesn't feel 
really intuitive right now. I wonder how much text is required, perhaps 
I will copy and paste more text here using notepad. Nope, this
is enough... The end!
Not the end! I will edit this in bash and push it back here with this line removed!
